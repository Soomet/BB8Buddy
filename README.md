# BB8Buddy

BB8Buddy is an iOS demo application that is meant to show how to integrate the Affdex SDK with the Sphero SDK to control their BB-8 remote control droid through facial expressions.

In order to use the project, you will need to:

- Obtain the Sphero SDK for iOS at http://developer.gosphero.com and place the contents at the root level of the project folder.
- Obtain the Affdex SDK for iOS at http://www.affdex.com/sdk and place it at the root level of the project folder.
- Add the license file that you receive from Affectiva to the project as 'sdk.license'.

Once these steps are complete, load the BB8Buddy Xcode project and verify that the references to the above frameworks and license are correct.
